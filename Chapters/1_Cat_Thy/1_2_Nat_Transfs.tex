\subsection{Adjoint Pairs}

Often, categories will be related but not quite equivalent. The idea is to define a weak notion of equivalence using the concept of \textbf{adjunction}. This is a very important concept in category theory, relevant not only to mathematicians but also to computer scientists.

The way that adjunctions are expressed are in terms of functors going both ways between two categories. These functions will express an adjunction if they are an \textbf{adjoint pair}, ie, if there is a specific relationship between them.
